# Degree Grader

A degree grading system which outputs a final degree classification.

The classification is based on 4 criteria - Module average, ISM average, compensatable failed credits, and failed modules.

The Degree grader works by calling the startDegreeGrading method, which is done so in the "TestDegreeGrader" class.

This project was written as a University project.
